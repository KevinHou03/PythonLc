Yes, potentially, the manager's method can improve the efficiency of the packing.
The current method has maximized the utility of a single truck, but not the whole team.
For example, fully stuffing every truck could make those boxes that could be potentially optimized by
being put at another truck with boxes of a different size/dimension being stuck in the "wrong" truck.
For this reason, we can not maximize the utility of the entire truck team.
By loading the truck with a more considerate arrangement could lower the space wasted by the disordered layout.
Moreover,although trucks might not be fully loaded, the number of truck used could be lowered due to more compact
stuffing of the boxes. In short, the local optimum can not ensure overall optimum, but if we try to solve the problem
from the big picture, the optimum could be achieved.

This problem is also known as the bin packing problem, which applies optimized combination of proble of different
sizes in order to maximize the usage and efficiency of the solution -- maximum lading with minimum container.
