'''
(a) It is O(n^3) because it looks like it creates a iterated new n x n matrix 
everytime for each k, so the space would be n x (n x n) = n^3

To fix this, we can use the same D rather than a new one during each iteration,
which means we can modify and update D in place. Also, we can modify pred by using
the same approach of updating in place rather than resetting it in each iteration. 
The pred[i][j] should only be updated when a shorter path through an intermediate 
node k is found.
